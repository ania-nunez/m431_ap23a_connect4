I'm Yara Cordero and I mainly did all the documentation.

I'm Ania Nunez and I've written all the code for our connect4 game.

## Introduction

This is our Project for the M431. It's a simple connect4 game, like the one you might know as a boardgame. You're able to play this game with a friend and see who will win.
