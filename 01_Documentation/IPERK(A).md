# Assessing

<br>


## Personal Reflections 

Yara <ul>
<li>I found the Assignment to have been very stressful on me. Sometimes things weren't done when they should've been done. I had a lot of going back to things and redoing it.</li>
<li>Nevertheless I had fun making the documentation of the game and helping Ania any time she needed it. We openly comminicated with eachother when we had any issues with code or documentation.</li>
<li>In retrosprect to what I have done for the Assignment, I will better myself in working more with the given examples and ask the teacher more for opinions on my work.</li>
</ul>

Ania <ul>
<li>I am Happy with the outcome of this Project.</li>
<li>I've learned alot and i think this Project will have positive and usefull outcome in the future.</li>
<li>I sometimes were a bit stressed to finishj the code and my part of the Documentation but we finished everything in time.</li>
</ul>


## What went well 

What we condsidered to been well done was the writing of our code. We had choosen to do a simple program to not make our documentation as difficult as for others. We had open comminucation with eachother. We discussed all the documentation files before completely commiting & pushing it to GitHub. At the end of the Assignment we have a finished product and all needed documents (documentation files) as we planned at the start of the semester. I find that is good archivement on our part. 

## What didn't go well

What rather didn't go aswell was our uploading to GitHub. We uploaded files more sporatically than others and didn't update our code weekly. It was difficult for both of us to see the updated code and work on it, when it wasn't uploaded. (To see precise Issues -> see Realize Document). We realized way to late that we should've split the work more fairly as one of us always had a lot to do and the other didn't.
